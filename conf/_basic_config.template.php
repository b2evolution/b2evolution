 * You do NOT need to edit this file. In most situations, the installer will do it for you.

 * You should edit _basic_config.php instead. If _basic_config.php doesn't exist yet, then
 * open _basic_config.template.php and SAVE it AS _basic_config.php.
 *
 * Reminder: every line starting with # or // is a comment, multiline comments are
 *           surrounded by '/*' and '* /' (without space).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Take special care not to erase quotes (') around text parameters
 * and semicolums (;) at the end of the lines. Otherwise you'll get some
 * "unexpected T_STRING" parse errors!
 *
 * Contributors: you should override this file by creating a file named _config_TEST.php

// - In view of reorganization, please list (all or examples) of situations where only a subset of the conf should be loaded.
